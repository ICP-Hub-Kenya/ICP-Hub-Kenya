I am working on a new deploy script file 

But I am getting this error: 
Prepare all required actions
Getting action download info
Run ./.github/actions/deploy
Run dfinity/setup-dfx@main
Run if [ "auto" = "latest" ]; then
DFX_VERSION is 
Executing dfxvm install script, commit: 87b3c4b77606d180fa7e7495a6b8cb4de1d8b7ce
Downloading latest release...
Checking integrity of tarball...
dfxvm-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz: OK
info: creating /home/runner/.local/share/dfx/env

Welcome to dfxvm!

This will install dfxvm, and download and install dfx.

The dfxvm and dfx commands will be added to the following directory:

   /home/runner/.local/share/dfx/bin

This path will then be added to your PATH environment variable by
modifying the profile files located at:

   /home/runner/.profile
   /home/runner/.bash_profile
   /home/runner/.bashrc

Current installation options:

            dfx version: latest
   modify PATH variable: yes

info: fetching https://sdk.dfinity.org/manifest.json
info: latest dfx version is 0.26.1
info: using existing install for dfx 0.26.1
info: dfx 0.26.1 is already the default version
info: already updates path: /home/runner/.profile
info: already updates path: /home/runner/.bash_profile
info: already updates path: /home/runner/.bashrc

dfxvm is installed now.

To get started you may need to restart your current shell.
This would reload your PATH environment variable to include
the dfxvm bin directory.

To configure your shell, run:
  source "$HOME/.local/share/dfx/env"

Run echo "$HOME/.local/share/dfx/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH
Run echo *** | base64 --decode > deploy_identity.pem
Imported identity: "deploy_identity".
Using identity: "deploy_identity".
Run dfx canister install  --network ic --wasm wasm/frontend.wasm.gz --mode upgrade
error: the following required arguments were not provided:
  --all

Usage: dfx canister install --network <NETWORK> --wasm <WASM> --mode <MODE> --all [CANISTER] [OUTPUT_ENV_FILE]

For more information, try '--help'.
Error: Process completed with exit code 2.

I see the issue in your deployment workflow. The error occurs because the `dfx canister install` command is missing the required `--all` flag and the canister name. Let me help you fix this in the deploy workflow file.

I'll examine the current workflow file and make the necessary corrections:
