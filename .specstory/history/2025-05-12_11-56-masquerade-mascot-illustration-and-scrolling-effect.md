# Masquerade: Mascot Illustration and Scrolling Effect (2025-05-12 14:56:54)

_**User**_

I want us to work on the mascot illustration over here 

So we'll be using two images, the @HeroHover.png and the @HeroMascot.png  

So the mascot should be on top of the herohover 

The hero hover should be a scroll effect, as it has rthe words "Internet computer hub, internet computer hub, internet computer hub...."

I hope you get the difference 

---

_**Assistant**_

Great, I understand your requirements:

- You want to use two images: `HeroMascot.png` (the astronaut/mascot) and `HeroHover.png` (the scrolling banner with the text and flag).
- The mascot should be positioned on top of the scrolling banner.
- The `HeroHover.png` should have a horizontal scrolling (marquee) effect, creating a dynamic banner behind the mascot.

**Plan:**
1. Add both images to the mascot illustration section.
2. Position the `HeroHover.png` as a horizontally scrolling background/banner.
3. Place the mascot (`HeroMascot.png`) above the scrolling banner, centered or left-aligned as you prefer.
4. Use CSS (and possibly a bit of JS/Framer Motion) to animate the scrolling effect for the banner.

Let me check if the images exist in your `/images` directory, and then I’ll update the code for this effect.

Both `HeroMascot.png` and `HeroHover.png` are present in your `/images` directory.

Here’s how I’ll proceed:
- Add a horizontally scrolling `HeroHover.png` as a banner.
- Overlay the `HeroMascot.png` above it, centered or left-aligned as in your current design.
- Use CSS animation for the scrolling effect.

I’ll update the mascot illustration section accordingly.

The mascot illustration section is now updated to:
- Show the `HeroHover.png` as a horizontally scrolling banner (marquee effect).
- Overlay the `HeroMascot.png` above the banner, floating as before.

**Next step:**  
To make the banner scroll, you need a CSS animation for the `.animate-marquee` class. Would you like me to add this CSS to your global styles (e.g., in your Tailwind config or a CSS file), or do you have a preferred location for custom styles?

---

_**User**_

Almost there, but the scrolling banner is not moving 

It should be moving from left to right

---

_**Assistant**_

To make the scrolling banner move from left to right, you need to add a CSS animation for the marquee effect. Here’s how you can do it:

### 1. Add the CSS for the marquee animation

You can add this to your global CSS file (e.g., `src/frontend/src/index.css` or `App.css`), or if you use Tailwind, you can extend your Tailwind config.  
For a quick solution, add the following CSS to your main stylesheet:

```css
@keyframes marquee-right {
  0% {
    transform: translateX(-50%);
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateX(0%);
  }
}

.animate-marquee {
  animation: marquee-right 15s linear infinite;
}
```

### 2. Why this works
- The `.animate-marquee` class will animate the inner div from left to right, creating a continuous scrolling effect.
- Duplicating the image ensures a seamless loop.

### 3. (Optional) Tailwind Customization
If you want to use Tailwind for this, you can extend your `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      keyframes: {
        'marquee-right': {
          '0%': { transform: 'translateX(-50%)' },
          '100%': { transform: 'translateX(0%)' },
        },
      },
      animation: {
        'marquee-right': 'marquee-right 15s linear infinite',
      },
    },
  },
};
```
Then use `animate-marquee-right` as your class.

---

**Summary:**  
Add the CSS above, and your banner will scroll from left to right as intended.  
Would you like me to add this CSS for you, and if so, which file should I use?

---

+   }
+ }
+ 
+ .animate-marquee {
+   animation: marquee-right 15s linear infinite;
+ } 
```

---

The marquee animation CSS has been added to your `src/index.css`.  
Your scrolling banner should now move smoothly from left to right behind the mascot.

**If you want to adjust the speed**, change the `15s` value in the animation property.

Let me know if you want to tweak the speed, direction, or anything else!

---

_**User**_

It works, almost there 

But now I don't even understand why the image is overlapping itself as you see from the attached image 

---

_**Assistant**_

Great observation! The overlapping is happening because the duplicated images in the marquee are not wide enough to cover the full width of the container before the animation loops, causing a visible "jump" or overlap.

### Why this happens:
- The two images are placed side by side, but if the combined width of both images is less than twice the width of the container, you’ll see a gap or overlap as the animation loops.
- The animation is set to move from `translateX(-50%)` to `translateX(0%)`, but if the content inside isn’t wide enough, it will not loop seamlessly.

---

## How to Fix

### 1. Ensure the marquee content is at least twice the width of the container
- The easiest way is to make sure the inner marquee (`w-max`) is wide enough, and the images fill the container horizontally.

### 2. Use Flex and Min-Width
- Set the images to `min-w-full` so each image is at least as wide as the container.
- Duplicate the image so the total width is at least 2x the container width.

### 3. Adjust the animation to move from `0%` to `-50%`
- This way, the first image scrolls out and the second image takes its place, creating a seamless loop.

---

## Solution: Update the CSS and JSX

### Update the CSS animation:
```css
@keyframes marquee-right {
  0% {
    transform: translateX(0%);
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateX(-50%);
  }
}
```

### Update the JSX for the images:
```jsx
<div className="animate-marquee flex w-[200%]">
  <img src="/images/HeroHover.png" alt="Scrolling Banner" className="min-w-full h-full object-contain" />
  <img src="/images/HeroHover.png" alt="Scrolling Banner" className="min-w-full h-full object-contain" />
</div>
```
- `w-[200%]` ensures the flex container is twice as wide as its parent.
- `min-w-full` ensures each image is at least as wide as the container.

-                   <img src="/images/HeroHover.png" alt="Scrolling Banner" className="h-full object-contain" style={{height: '90px'}} />
-                   {/* Duplicate for seamless loop */}

                  </div>
                </div>

```diff
  @keyframes marquee-right {
    0% {
-     transform: translateX(-50%);

    }
    100% {
-     transform: translateX(0%);
+     transform: translateX(-50%);
    }
  }
```

---

The changes are complete! Now, the scrolling banner should move smoothly from left to right without overlapping or visible jumps. The images will loop seamlessly, filling the width of the container.

If you need to adjust the speed, just change the duration in the `.animate-marquee` class (e.g., `15s` to another value).

Let me know if you want any further tweaks or if everything looks good!

_**User**_

As you can see now it even looks worse 

The scrolling banner looks bigger, it should look smaller 

Then it overflows to the next component which is the about component, it should exactly be at the end of the hero section component, and not overflow to the bottom 

Then we have the two sides that are not matching i.e the 2nd layer of the scrolling banner is on top of the first layer 

Also, there's a huge gap between the 2nd repeating scroll banner and the first one

I hope you understand now

---

_**Assistant**_

Thank you for the detailed feedback and screenshot! Here’s a summary of the issues and how to address them:

---

### Issues Identified

1. **Banner is too big:**  
   The scrolling banner appears taller than intended.

2. **Banner overflows into the next section:**  
   The banner is not contained within the hero section and spills into the About section.

3. **Misaligned/overlapping banners:**  
   The repeated banner images are not seamlessly aligned, causing a visible gap and stacking.

4. **Huge gap between repeats:**  
   The duplicated images are not perfectly adjacent, causing a visible gap.

---

## Solutions

### 1. **Reduce Banner Height**
- Set a fixed, smaller height for the banner and its images (e.g., 48px or 56px).

### 2. **Contain the Banner**
- Ensure the mascot illustration container does not overflow its parent.
- Remove unnecessary padding/margins and set `overflow-hidden` on the hero section or mascot container.

### 3. **Seamless Marquee**
- Use `flex-nowrap` and ensure both images are exactly adjacent.
- Use `object-cover` or `object-fill` if needed, but `object-contain` is usually best for banners.
- Remove any extra width or margin that could cause a gap.

### 4. **No Overlap**
- The two images should be side by side, not stacked.
- The container should be `relative`, and the images should not have absolute positioning.

---

## Example Fix

Here’s how you can update your mascot illustration section for a clean, seamless, and contained marquee:

### **JSX Update**
```jsx
<div
  className="w-full flex justify-center items-end pointer-events-none pb-0 relative overflow-hidden"
  style={{ height: '220px' }} // Adjust height as needed
>
  {/* Scrolling Banner */}
  <div className="absolute left-0 bottom-0 w-full z-10" style={{ height: '56px' }}>
    <div className="relative w-full h-full overflow-hidden">
      <div className="animate-marquee flex flex-nowrap w-[200%]">
        <img
          src="/images/HeroHover.png"
          alt="Scrolling Banner"
          className="h-full min-w-[50%] object-contain"
          style={{ maxHeight: '56px' }}
        />
        <img
          src="/images/HeroHover.png"
          alt="Scrolling Banner"
          className="h-full min-w-[50%] object-contain"
          style={{ maxHeight: '56px' }}
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  {/* Mascot on top */}
  <motion.img
    src="/images/HeroMascot.png"
    alt="ICP Mascot"
    className="z-20 mx-auto object-contain"
    style={{ height: '180px', width: 'auto', position: 'relative' }}
    variants={mascotVariants}
    // animate="float"
  />
</div>
```

### **CSS/Style Update**
- Make sure the parent containers have `overflow-hidden`.
- Adjust the height values (`56px` for the banner, `180px` for the mascot) to your design needs.

The mascot illustration section has been refactored as follows:
- The scrolling banner is now smaller (56px high), seamless, and contained within the hero section.
- The mascot sits above the banner, with a height of 180px.
- Overflow issues and gaps between the repeated banners should be resolved.
- The banner will not overflow into the next section.

Please check the result in your browser. If you want further adjustments (e.g., different heights, spacing, or mascot position), let me know!

_**User**_

I still don't get why the first scroll banner is overlapping the second one 

Also, there's some spacing between the second scrolling banner and the first one, the space doesn't need to be there

---

_**Assistant**_

You are correct—there should be no visible gap or overlap between the two scrolling banners. The issue is likely due to the sizing of the images and the flex container. Here’s what’s happening and how to fix it:

---

## Why This Happens

- **min-w-[50%]** on each image means each image is 50% of the container, but if the image itself is not exactly half the width of the container, you get gaps or overlaps.
- The images must be exactly adjacent, with no extra width or margin.
- The flex container (`w-[200%]`) and the images must be sized so that the two images together fill the container exactly, and the animation moves by exactly one image width.

---

## The Correct Approach

1. **Each image should be `w-full` (100% of the container width), not 50%.**
2. **The flex container should be `w-[200%]` so both images together are twice the width of the container.**
3. **No margin, padding, or border on the images.**
4. **Use `object-cover` or `object-fill` if you want the image to stretch, but for banners, `object-contain` is usually best.**

---

## Solution

### Update the JSX for the Banner

```jsx
<div className="animate-marquee flex w-[200%]">
  <img
    src="/images/HeroHover.png"
    alt="Scrolling Banner"
    className="h-full w-full object-contain"
    style={{ maxHeight: '56px' }}
  />
  <img
    src="/images/HeroHover.png"
    alt="Scrolling Banner"
    className="h-full w-full object-contain"
    style={{ maxHeight: '56px' }}
  />
</div>
```

- `w-full` ensures each image is exactly the width of the container.
- The flex container is `w-[200%]`, so both images together are twice the width of the container, and the animation moves by 50%.

---

### Double-Check the Animation

Your CSS should be:
```css
@keyframes marquee-right {
  0% {
    transform: translateX(0%);
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateX(-50%);
  }
}
.animate-marquee {
  animation: marquee-right 15s linear infinite;
}
```

---

### Summary

- Use `w-full` for each image.
- Use `w-[200%]` for the flex container.
- No margin, padding, or border on the images.
- Animation should move from `0%` to `-50%`.
